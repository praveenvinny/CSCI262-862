Inconsistency 1:
The number given at the first line of count is incorrect.
Solution: We have to read through the file to identify the number of inputs.

Inconsistency 2:
Each set of inputs are not terminated by a new line character.
Solution: We have to loop in through each set of objects in order to count the values.

Inconsistency 3:
One of the values is missing in the input line.
Solution: Not addressed

Inconsistency 4:
An extra space in between the format of the registration number.
Solution: This is addressed by removing the extra space.

Inconsistency 5:
The symbol in between each input is not a ':' but something else.
Solution: Not addressed

Inconsistency 6:
A null value instead of an input between one ':' and the next ':'
Solution: If the value is a ':', it needs to treated as zero while reading.

Inconsistency 7:
There is no value for count at the beginning of the file.
Solution: We have to loop through the file and identify the count. If it's not there, we should be adding the right value.
